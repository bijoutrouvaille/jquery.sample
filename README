JQUERY.SAMPLE

The idea is to avoid having facial hair in your templates and use clean and clear HTML. It is not mine, but belongs to hij1nx and his incomplete, but still wonderful weld.js @ https://github.com/hij1nx/weld

HOW IT WORKS

Here's an example template:

= = = = = =
<div id="robots">
  <div class='robot'>
     <span class='name'></span> 
     <a href='/robots' class='model'></a>
  </div>
</div>
= = = = = =


AUTOMATIC BINDING

The automatic method simply looks for attributes class, id, or name and matches them to the data passed.

    $('.robot').sample({name:'zigzag', model:'blacksheep'});

The attributes are set depending on the element:
input - value or checked
img - src
label - will prepend text
evertything else - will set the text of, as in $('.robot .name').text ('zigzag')


This is nice but we have many robots with different names:

    $('#robots').sample([{name:'zigzag', model:'blacksheep'},{name:'twizzler',model:'blacksheep'}])

This will clone the element and insert the sampled items after the original.

MAPPED BINDING

Now we want the model anchor to link us to individual model's URL's - this is where maps come in:

    data = {name:'zigzag', model:'blacksheep', linkUrl:'/robots/blacksheep'}
    map  = {".model/href":"linkUrl"}
    $('.robot').sample(data, map )

This will perform the basic matching and overlap it with the mapping.

 -=- =-= -=- =-= -=- =-= -=- =-= -=- =-= -=-

FUN WITH MAPS

data = {colors : ['red','green','purple']} 
map  = {"select.color/options": colors}

data = { colors : [{text:'red',value:'1'},{text:'green',value:'2'},{text:'purple',value:'3'}], selectedColor: '3' } 
map  = {"select.color/options": 'colors', "select.color/value": 'selectedColor'}

data = {isEvil:false}
map = {"input.evil/checked": 'isEvil'}


MAP STRUCTURE

"selector/property" : 'data key name'
The property can be either: html, text (alias: txt), value (alias: val), checked, and options.


HTML STRINGS

You can use $.sample (html, data, map) to obtain an html string of sampled results.

You've heard it, now sample it!
